# Admissions Predictions

The purpose of this neural network is to predict whether a college is selective or not based on attributes. The current model is using 75th percentile ACT scores, admittance rate percentages, total enrollment, total out-of-state price, percent of enrollment that is non-white, historically black university status (dummy variable), and percent of total enrollment that is women as predictors for whether a college is selective.
