# Admissions Predictions

The purpose of this neural network is to predict whether a college is selective or not based on attributes. The current model is using 75th percentile ACT scores, admittance rate percentages, total enrollment, total out-of-state price, percent of enrollment that is non-white, historically black university status (dummy variable), and percent of total enrollment that is women as predictors for whether a college is selective.

The purpose of this neural network is to predict whether a college is selective or not based on attributes.
- The current model is using:
- 75th percentile ACT scores
- Admittance rate percentages
- Total enrollment
- Total out-of-state price
- Percent of enrollment that is non-white
- Historically black university status (dummy variable)
- Percent of total enrollment that is women

These are useful predictors for whether a college is selective. I define a 'selective' university as one that has an acceptance rate of less than 50%.
